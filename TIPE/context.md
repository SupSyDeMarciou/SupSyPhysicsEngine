# TIPE
The [**TIPE**](https://www.scei-concours.fr/tipe.php) is part of the French engineering school entrance exams and is the creation of a project (individualy or with a team) which relates to a specific theme given to all students of the same year.
The end goal is to make a 15 minutes presentation in front of a jury detailing your project, your struggles and your process as well as the final results and possible improvements that could improve on them.

I obtained the best possible grade (20/20) with this project and the presentation in this folder.

It is also for this TIPE that I have developped the [**SupSyLibrairies**](https://github.com/SupSyDeMarciou/SupSyLibrairies) and [**SupSyGameEngine**](https://github.com/SupSyDeMarciou/SupSyGameEngine) to be able to better visualize the solids and their movements.
